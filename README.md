7A. If you wish to move the stage some place else, Edit the LUA script and re-locate and punch in new Cords for the band members and spells and game objects.
7b. Then go ontop on the stage and do ".gps" and punch in the new cords for each band member in the script and the spells and gameobjects.
7d. Be sure you have changed all the cords to the correct locations.
7e. Also, Be sure the spawn point of "Spellcaster1" is "UNDER" the stage just not through the world.
